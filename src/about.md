  <p>The main idea is coming from different sources.
  Some questions are borrowed from 
  <a href="https://thoughtquestions.com" target="_blank">Thought Questions</a>
  which seems to be inactive since 2014.
</p>
<p>
  In my opinion, thinking is a much better way to spend our free time.
  So, the next time you find yourself struggling deciding what to do,
  open this minimal website and think about the question(s) it shows.
</p>
<p>
  Or, you can share it with your friends (on Twitter, Instagram, etc.) and build a useful conversation.

<p>It's an open-source website developed using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">11ty</a>. You can contribute if you're interested.

  Feel free to suggest new questions. That'd be appreciated.

<p><strong>Is there any wrong question?</strong></p>
