## History
Initially this website was developed using ASP.NET Core and TailwindCSS. But I decided to go free, lower the complexity, and take advantage of GitHub Pages and Static Sites benefits.

Currently it's based on 11ty Static Site Generator. TailwindCSS is dropped; no need, since it's a minimal website.
